**3. Key Features (Hackathon MVP)**

**3.1. Core Feature: Dynamic Image Generation & Editing (Powered by Nano Banana)**
*   **FR-1.1: Text-to-Image Generation:** Users can generate entirely new images based on detailed natural language prompts (e.g., "A golden retriever wearing a wizard hat flying over a rainbow").
*   **FR-1.2: Image-to-Image Transformation (Blended Realities):** Users can upload an existing photo and use natural language to modify it.
    *   *Examples:* "Change the dull sky to a vibrant sunset," "Add a subtle rainbow in the background," "Remove the person in the blue hat."
    *   *Examples for virtual placement:* "Put a cozy fireplace in this living room," "Add a bouquet of roses on the table."
*   **FR-1.3: Consistent Character/Subject Rerendering:** For a given uploaded subject (e.g., a pet photo), the system can generate the subject in new poses, settings, or with new attributes while maintaining visual consistency.
    *   *Example:* Upload a photo of "Charlie the dog." Prompt: "Show Charlie battling a giant squirrel in a forest," then "Now show Charlie celebrating with a tiny trophy."
*   **FR-1.4: Style Transfer & Enhancement:** Users can apply stylistic changes with natural language (e.g., "Make this photo look like a watercolor painting," "Enhance the colors to be more vibrant").

**3.2. Core Feature: Audio Narration & Personalization (Powered by ElevenLabs)**
*   **FR-2.1: Text-to-Speech Narration:** Users can input text to generate a spoken voice-over for their created image.
*   **FR-2.2: Emotion & Voice Customization:** Users can select different voice styles (e.g., cheerful, serious, excited) and potentially different speaker identities for their narration.
*   **FR-2.3: Integrated Playback:** The generated voice-over is seamlessly integrated with the image, creating a short, shareable audio-visual clip.

**3.3. Core Feature: Rapid Processing & User Experience (Powered by Fal)**
*   **FR-3.1: Fast Image & Audio Generation:** The application must provide near real-time generation of images and audio to support a fluid user workflow (leveraging Fal for accelerated inference).
*   **FR-3.2: Intuitive Web Interface:** A clean, mobile-responsive UI that prioritizes ease of use for natural language input and content preview.

**3.4. Sharing & Output**
*   **FR-4.1: Download Options:** Users can download their final creations as images (PNG/JPG) or short video clips (MP4/GIF, integrating image and audio).
*   **FR-4.2: Direct Share:** Quick links to share content directly to popular social media and messaging platforms.

**4. User Flow (Example: Creating a Pet Announcement)**
1.  **Launch MomentsAI:** User navigates to the MomentsAI web application.
2.  **Choose Mode:** User selects "Create New Scene" or "Enhance Existing Photo."
3.  **Input/Upload:** If "Create New Scene," user types a prompt (e.g., "My golden retriever, Charlie, wearing a tiny wizard hat, flying over a rainbow"). If "Enhance Existing Photo," user uploads a photo of Charlie.
4.  **Generate Image:** User clicks "Generate." Nano Banana processes the prompt and displays the generated image. 
5.  **Refine (Optional):** User can adjust the prompt ("Make the rainbow colors more vibrant") and regenerate.
6.  **Add Audio (Optional):** User clicks "Add Voice-Over" and types a message (e.g., "Meet Charlie, our new family wizard!").
7.  **Generate Audio:** User selects a voice style, clicks "Generate Audio." ElevenLabs creates the voice clip.
8.  **Preview & Finalize:** User previews the combined image and audio.
9.  **Share/Download:** User downloads the MP4/GIF or shares directly to social media.

**5. Technical Architecture (High-Level)**
*   **Frontend:** Responsive web application (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) optimized for mobile.
*   **Backend/API Gateway:** Handles user requests, orchestrates API calls.
*   **Image Generation:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview (Nano Banana) API.
*   **Audio Generation:** ElevenLabs API.
*   **Compute/Inference Acceleration:** Fal API for efficient processing of image and audio generation requests.
*   **Hosting:** AI Studio Apps / Cloud Run (as encouraged by the hackathon).

**6. API Limitations & Considerations (Hackathon Specific)**
*   **Rate Limits:** Adhere to 20 images/minute, 200 requests/project/day for Gemini API. Implement client-side feedback for users when limits are approached.
*   **Cost:** Utilize free tier API keys for hackathon submission to avoid charges, as per guidelines.

**7. Success Metrics (Hackathon Specific)**
*   Successful deployment of a functional web application.
*   Demonstration of all key features (FR-1.1 to FR-4.2) in the video.
*   Clear showcasing of Nano Banana's core strengths (dynamic creation, consistency, blending, natural language editing).
*   Effective integration and visible benefit from ElevenLabs and Fal.
*   Positive feedback from judges on innovation, utility, and execution.

**8. Future Considerations (Post-Hackathon)**
*   User accounts and content storage.
*   More advanced editing tools (e.g., brush masking, inpainting/out-painting).
*   Community sharing features.
*   Monetization strategies (e.g., premium features, higher rate limits).
